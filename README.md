# BMS-ui-web

This is a part of the final year project done by Tharun
Prabhu and Magesh J from the dept. of EEE, SASTRA Deemed to be
University. **Battery Management System with cloud sharing**. Node.js for the
backend and MongoDB for the database. 

The map integration is
accomplished using a well-known library - (Leaflet.js)[https://leafletjs.com/]. The battery
statistics are displayed as a well organized chart with the help of an
open source library - (Chart.js)[https://www.chartjs.org/]. The data from the mongoDB database is
fed to the front end using (mongoose)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose] - an open source JS library.
